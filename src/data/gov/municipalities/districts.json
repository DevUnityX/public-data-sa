The seat of iLembe is KwaDukuza (previously Stanger). The town straddles the Tugela River, the traditional border between former Colonial Natal and the Kingdom of Zululand, the site of historical and cultural events. The majority of the rural inland areas are tribal authority areas, characterised by subsistence farming. At the border of the district is the Unicity of Durban in the immediate south, which is linked by the coastal highway to Richards Bay in the north, giving it access to both harbours for trade purposes. It is also a leading place for the tourism industry because of its rich Zulu Kingdom heritage, as it was named in recognition of King Shaka.",

    "description": "The Sedibeng District Municipality is a Category C municipality situated on the southern tip of the Gauteng Province and strategically located on the border of three other provinces, namely Free State, North West and Mpumalanga. The municipality is the only area in the province that is situated on the banks of the Vaal River and Vaal Dam, covering the area formerly known as the Vaal Triangle. The municipality is a stones throw from Johannesburg along the scenic Vaal, Klip and Suikerbos Rivers. It is comprised of the Emfuleni, Lesedi and Midvaal Local Municipalities, and includes the historic townships of Evaton, Sebokeng, Boipatong, Bophelong, Sharpeville and Ratanda, which have a rich political history and heritage.  It has a variety of attractions offering a vast cultural heritage and historical experience including, among others, the political breakthroughs that led to the country's political turnabout. The Sedibeng region boasts several Heritage Sites related to the South African War of 1899-1902 and the two World Wars that followed. The Sharpeville Memorial Precinct stands as a reminder of the Sharpeville Massacre of 21 March 1960, when 69 people lost their lives while protesting the pass laws of the then apartheid South Africa. Sedibeng is the fourth-largest contributor to the Gauteng economy. The predominant economic sector in the district is the manufacturing of fabricated metal and chemicals. In the metal sector, the Arcelor-Mittal Steel plant, the Cape Gate Davsteel Wire and Steel plant, and the Ferromanganese plant of Samancor are the three main large baseline plants in the district, while DCDDorbyl Heavy Engineering is the biggest manufacturer of engineered products in Southern Africa. The well-developed national road network that cuts across the district to all the provinces ensures that the region remains the industrial centre of the Gauteng Province. The municipality is 40km away from Johannesburg and 80km away from Pretoria, without the high traffic volumes. The municipality offers the best opportunity for growth and development as a result of availability of land for both residential and commercial development in a picturesque and tranquil setting. The Vaal University of Technology and the North-West University's Vaal Campus offer a wide range of graduates that provide the bulwark of employees for business and industries that seek to set up operations in Sedibeng.",

The district is made up of four local municipalities: Umdoni, uMzumbe, Ray Nkonyeni and Umuziwabantu, all of which have played a critical role in the cultivation of the district’s economy. The Ray Nkonyeni Municipality is the ultimate economy booster due to its location. Commercial agriculture in the district produces one-fifth of all bananas consumed in South Africa, with numerous companies successfully exporting these and other products to some of the most exclusive packers in the United Kingdom. The Ugu District is the proud owner of Blue Flag Status beaches, which have marked tourism as a major economic cultivator. The improvement of its infrastructure, education, health and recreational facilities contributes immensely to its appeal. The nurturing of the local economy highly features tourism and agriculture, and includes the district’s very own Ugu Jazz Festival. It also includes other renowned annual activities, such as the Africa Bike Week, which have gained momentum worldwide.",

    "description": "The West Rand District Municipality is a Category C municipality located in the west of the Gauteng Province. The West Rand extends from Randfontein (the seat of the district) in the west to Roodepoort in the east, and includes the town of Krugersdorp. It is bordered by Bojanala Platinum to the north-west, City of Tshwane to the north-east, City of Johannesburg to the east, Sedibeng to the south-east, and Dr Kenneth Kaunda to the south-west. It comprises three local municipalities: Merafong, Mogale and Rand West Cities. The municipality is situated relatively closely to the hub of economic activity in Gauteng, and is transversed by major national roads, namely the N12 and N14. Its main contribution lies primarily within the mining sector, however, areas such as Krugersdorp fulfil a residential function for many people working in Johannesburg. The West Rand remains the poorest region contributing to Gauteng's GDP. The Cradle of Humankind falls under the jurisdiction of Mogale City and Merafong City, and forms part of the World Heritage Site.",
