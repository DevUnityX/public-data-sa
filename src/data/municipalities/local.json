It is one of the five municipalities that make up the district, accounting for 11% of its geographical area. It was established from the former Groblershoop Municipality, from settlements that were previously part of the ZF Mgcawu and Karoo District Municipalities. These municipalities administrated these settlements and provided them with services up until the demarcation in November 2000. From December 2000, !Kheis Municipality took over services and personnel, and total service provision took place from 1 July 2001. The !Kheis municipal area was initially inhabited by the Khoisan people, who were also the first permanent inhabitants of South Africa. The San, who lived a nomadic life, migrated through the area. !Kheis is a Khoi name meaning ‘a place where you live' or ‘your home'. The existing roads in the !Kheis municipal area are mainly gravel. The main road (N10) from Upington to Groblershoop is a tar road. Groblershoop is also connected by the N8 to Griekwastad and by the N10 to Marydale. Due to the climate of the area, there is huge potential to utilise solar energy more widely, especially in the remote areas of the district. The Orange River stretches through the area, from the south-east to the north-west. The presence of perennial river water contributes to the establishment of table grapes, which are marketed and exported to Western Europe.",

It is one of six municipalities in the district. The municipality changed its name from Engcobo Local Municipality to Dr AB Xuma Local Municipality in June 2022. The municipality claims the most youthful population, as well as the highest rates of poverty and unemployment, in the district, coupled with a high dependency ratio. The economy is underperforming and currently fails to create needed jobs and revenues. A dedicated LED strategy has been developed in order to guide interventions in turning this situation around. The municipality’s low productivity score points to the low GDP per worker (formal and informal), a relative shortage of skills available to the economy, and low growth. On a broad scale, the Dr AB Xuma Municipality has some striking features: it is a peripheral area in terms of the national economy, is underdeveloped, has a fragmented settlement pattern, has a low-density rural settlement environment, and its resource base is under pressure. On the scale of urban development, Engcobo Town is classified as a Sub-District Development Node by CHDM (i.e. it is among a group of towns deemed to be on a second tier below the dominant district node of Komani). This means that Engcobo is understood to have an influence (reach or catchment population) beyond simply its local area and that it draws people to the town to access goods and services from a broader area (i.e. in some cases even from neighbouring municipalities). However, Engcobo may also currently be described as a low-density urban environment. In spite of its low density and intensity of development, Engcobo’s business centre is thriving, though it does not function optimally due to overcrowding and a lack of facilities serving both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Business in the town is reliant on commuters (rural consumers) and there is no mass of resident consumers. This limits the range of commercial and social facilities that the private sector provides in town and inhibits the development of a more vibrant urban character.",

There are very low levels of employment in the rural settlements. This can be partly attributed to the fact that these areas do not have a strong economic base, and partly to the fact that most inhabitants are involved in subsistence-related activities with little surplus being produced for economic profit. Due to the migrant system in operation in South Africa, the impact of recessionary downturns in the economy elsewhere (such as in the mining industry, Gauteng and Cape Town) have had an impact on the Elundini area.

In exchange for news of Cape Town and the civilized world, as well as gossip garnered from other farms along the way, these isolated farmers of the interior offered accommodation, sustenance and fodder. Many early officials and explorers, such as Barrow, Lichtenstein, De Mist and Swellengrebel, wrote of the people they met in what was later to become the district of Laingsburg. They described the Karoo as ‘awesome, hot, dry and dusty. An inhospitable land peppered with friendly outspans, veritable jewels in the desert'.

Its boundaries enclose some of the richest gold mines in the world. Formerly a cross-border municipality, the entire municipality was transferred to the North West Province following the abolition of cross-border municipalities by an amendment to the South African Constitution in 2005. The municipality was part of the North West Province from 2005 to 2009, when it was reincorporated into the Gauteng Province by another amendment to the Constitution, following often violent protests in the township of Khutsong. Merafong's historical development is closely knit with the discovery of rich gold deposits in the early 1930s. Fochville is the oldest town in the region, and was declared a town in 1951. The town Carletonville was named after Guy Carleton Jones, an engineer from the Gold Fields Ltd mining company, who played a prominent role in the discovery of the West Wits gold field, of which Carletonville forms a part. The mining company decided, in November 1946, to establish the town. Carletonville was proclaimed in 1948 and attained Town Council Status on 1 July 1959. Wedela is situated between Western Deep Levels and Elandsrand mine. The town's name is derived from the prefixes of the two mines: the ‘Wed-' from Western Deep Levels and the ‘-ela' from Elandsrand. Wedela was established as a mining village in December 1978 by Harry Oppenheimer, and municipal status was granted to the town on 1 January 1990.",

The town was strategically placed, in 1854, by the Surveyor General of the Natal Colony, Dr PC Sutherland. The town was later known as the Waterfall River Township because of the Ncandu River. In 1864, the town of Newcastle was founded on the site, becoming the fourth town to be established in Natal. The town was named after the British Colonial Secretary, the Duke of Newcastle. Newcastle functioned as a major transport junction and popular stopover for wagons and post-chaises during the late 1800s. In 1890, the first train arrived in Newcastle. In 1891, Newcastle was declared a borough. The discovery of coal brought a new era of prosperity to the town and several ambitious building projects were planned for Newcastle in the late 1900s.",

The Renoster River also drains through the region and is dammed up in the vicinity of Koppies in a series of dams, namely the Weltevrede, Rooipoort and Koppies Dams. The rivers, together with the respective dams, are prominent water sources for agricultural purposes in the region. Other prominent topographical features include the Vredefort Dome in Parys. The form of the dome consists of a central cone of granite surrounded by concentric ridges of quartzite belonging to the Witwatersrand System. The Parys District has unique natural and environmental assets, like the Vaal River, with several islands in the proximity of Parys, and the Vredefort Dome, that present exceptional tourism potential. Parys has a well-developed airfield that supports commercial and tourism development in the area. It has a strong commercial component and provides a wide range of services regarding health, education and professional services to the district. Vredefort is the only town that formed the former Vredefort District. The former Heilbron District is predominantly an agricultural area, although major manufacturing industries contribute largely to the Gross Geographic Product of the district. Koppies is located in an area of agricultural significance and mainly provides services in this regard to the surrounding rural areas. The three well-established and developed irrigation schemes subsequently enhance the agricultural character of the area. The strategic location of Koppies between the larger centres of Kroonstad and Sasolburg influence growth and development within the community. The bentonite exploitation near Koppies and the initiative for coal mining in the vicinity of the town provide significant future growth potential. Koppies is becoming known for its tourist attractions. Specific reference is made to the R82 Battlefield Route, which consists of several historical battlefields. These that are envisaged to be further developed along with the Koppies Dam Nature Reserve. Edenville is also located in an area of agricultural significance.

It is defined as a semi-desert area with a unique and sensitive natural environment. It was once the indigenous home of the Khoisan people, and so there are many rock paintings to be found. The municipality's development potential recognises the impact of being home to the world’s largest ostrich population, which is a key component of their agricultural industry. The discovery of the Cango Caves and continual allure of unique natural heritage has drawn people to this region. Oudtshoorn serves as a regional centre for the surrounding agricultural area. The natural environment of the area creates a natural hospitality towards the tourism industry, and a related boom in accommodation. Oudtshoorn is a centre of regional cultural, sport and art activities, and has, since 1994, been host to the nationally famous Klein Karoo Nasionale Kuntefees (KKNK), an arts festival held in March/April every year. A total of 411 temporary job opportunities were created directly by the ABSA KKNK, of which 76% were filled by black employees. The total economic impact of the ABSA KKNK is estimated at about R110 million, which makes the festival a major contributor to the economy in Oudtshoorn. A joint strategy was developed through the Greater Oudtshoorn Vision 2030 process to ensure both the broader benefaction of local communities and the sustainability of the festival. Oudtshoorn's relatively higher ‘development potential' is directly linked to its geographic location on main transport routes, natural resource base, human resources, institutional centre function, and commercial services. Recent studies of Oudtshoorn growth potential identified it as one of 14 important ‘leader towns' in the Western Cape province.",

In February 2002, the city was renamed Polokwane – a northern Sesotho word that means ‘place of safety'. The municipal spatial pattern reflects that of the historic apartheid city model, characterised by segregated settlement. At the centre of the area is the Polokwane economic hub, which comprises the central business district, industrial area, and a range of social services and well-established formal urban areas servicing the more affluent residents of Polokwane. Situated on the outskirts in several clusters are less formal settlement areas, which are experiencing enormous influx from rural urban migration trends. These areas are in dire need of upgraded services and infrastructure, both social and engineering, and are struggling to cope with the informal influx of more and more people who want access to an improved quality and standard of living.",

The meaning of Siyathemba is ‘we hope'. Prieska was originally named Prieschap, a Koranna word meaning ‘place of the lost she-goat', and used to be a fording place for travellers over the Orange River. Known to the locals as ‘the gem of the Northern Cape', Prieska is the seat of the municipality and is located on the hills of the Doring Mountains on the southern banks of the Orange River. Prieska's infrastructure is impressive – it has Eskom power; an abundant water supply from the Orange River, with the Gariep and the Vanderkloof Dams on the upstream side of the river; easy access to the main railway line to Namibia; good tarred road linkage with Kimberley, Upington and De Aar; two landing strips for light aircraft; and complete and reasonably inexpensive industrial stands, with or without siding facilities. Industrial activities include: grain silos; a cotton mill; a bakery; manufacture of furniture, built-in cupboards; cattle fodder pellets; and a tiger’s eye processing plant. Niekerkshoop is attractively placed between hills, and large trees shade the streets. There is no domestic water supply but irrigation water is supplied by a spring to the north of the town. On the north-west side of Marydale is a rich underground water source, and the main means of water supply is by borehole and wind pumps. It depends mainly on sheep farming.",

The town obtained municipal status in 1860. Malmesbury fulfils an important urban niche in the region and the province. Its high development potential can be attributed to factors such as its relative accessibility along the N7 road/rail corridor; closeness to Cape Town; diversified economic base, which not only accommodates agriculture but also well-developed industrial and commercial sectors; and supportive infrastructure. The high property values in the Cape Town Metropole and the attraction of a local tranquil atmosphere are moving people to settle here and commute to Cape Town on a daily basis.

The importance of Ixopo cannot be underestimated in the socio-economic development of the area as a whole. Ixopo plays an important role in terms of the possible location for industry, commerce and other economic activity. It is a major education and health centre, and assists in the diffusion of new ideas and technologies to the rural areas. It is also the primary base for the operation of many departments and service providers. In line with the KwaZulu-Natal Integrated Rural Development Policy, a number of secondary development nodes have been identified. The intention of secondary development nodes is to identify well-located settlements where government and municipal services, administrative functions, and commercial and residential development will be encouraged to locate in the future. The secondary and tertiary development nodes identified are: Highflats, Hlutankungu (previously Stuartsville), Jolivet, KwaBhidla, Emgodi and Hlokozi.",

However, in the remaining portion there are towns built by German immigrants some 150 years ago. In the 1850s, 13 cotton planter families from Osnabruck unter Bergthell left Germany and settled in the area. They were followed by missionaries and other colonists, mostly from Hanover, who also settled in the region, founded New Hanover and Wartburg, and brought with them not only the Lutheran faith but the German language and culture. Wartburg itself is named after the castle in Eisenach, where Dr Martin Luther translated the bible into German. The village crest also depicts the immigrants’ arrival by sailing ship, the Luther Rose, and the call to ‘pray and work'. The land is mostly agricultural, although urban development is to be found in the main towns. The communities living in the underdeveloped areas have extremely limited access to basic physical and social requirements and very few economic opportunities. The present authority structures are, as yet, unable to provide for the improvement of basic living conditions urgently required by the rural inhabitants.",

This effectively isolates the area from the immediate surrounding municipal areas. uMsinga is accessible via the R33, linking it with Dundee, uMnambithi (Ladysmith), Pietermaritzburg, Kranskop and Weenen. It is a largely rural area, with 70% of its area being traditional authority land held in trust by the Ingonyama Trust. The remaining 30% of land is commercial farmland, all of which is located to the north of Pomeroy. Due to the rural nature of the municipality, approximately 99% of the population lives in traditional areas. The population dynamics result in a growing rural area and a declining urban area in uMsinga, contrary to most other areas in the country. This can be attributed to the fact that the urban areas of uMsinga are very small and are unable to provide the normal range of goods and services provided in urban areas. As a result, the population utilises the neighbouring areas of Emnambithi and Umvoti for urban services. The strong traditional culture, particularly prevalent in uMsinga, is a valuable asset that must be preserved and valued.
