    "description": "The !Kheis Local Municipality is a Category B municipality situated within the ZF Mgcawu District in the Northern Cape Province. It is one of the five municipalities that make up the district, accounting for 11% of its geographical area. It was established from the former Groblershoop Municipality, from settlements that were previously part of the ZF Mgcawu and Karoo District Municipalities. These municipalities administrated these settlements and provided them with services up until the demarcation in November 2000. From December 2000, !Kheis Municipality took over services and personnel, and total service provision took place from 1 July 2001. The !Kheis municipal area was initially inhabited by the Khoisan people, who were also the first permanent inhabitants of South Africa. The San, who lived a nomadic life, migrated through the area. !Kheis is a Khoi name meaning ‘a place where you live' or ‘your home'. The existing roads in the !Kheis municipal area are mainly gravel. The main road (N10) from Upington to Groblershoop is a tar road. Groblershoop is also connected by the N8 to Griekwastad and by the N10 to Marydale. Due to the climate of the area, there is huge potential to utilise solar energy more widely, especially in the remote areas of the district. The Orange River stretches through the area, from the south-east to the north-west. The presence of perennial river water contributes to the establishment of table grapes, which are marketed and exported to Western Europe.",

The municipality strives to improve basic services with limited resources, however, the upgrading and maintenance of basic services remain a challenge. Strategic partnerships have become increasingly important, as illustrated by council’s high expenditure on MIG projects and active participation in EPWP projects. Environmental issues have become an important factor for the municipality to consider, especially with the effects of global warming and climate change. The municipality is endeavouring to integrate the effects and consequences of global warming and climate change into the general planning of service delivery, as can be seen in the municipality’s awarding of a waste to energy bioproject to Ark Industries. The municipality has created adequate capacity to deliver in critical departments such as economic development, human settlements and human development. Good governance has always been a priority for the council and the establishment of a Risk Management Unit, an Internal Audit Unit, a Municipal Public Accounts Committee, as well as more than 13 years of unqualified audit reports, is a testimony to this.",

    "description": "The Dr AB Xuma Local Municipality is a Category B municipality situated in the Chris Hani District in the Eastern Cape Province. It is one of six municipalities in the district. The municipality changed its name from Engcobo Local Municipality to Dr AB Xuma Local Municipality in June 2022. The municipality claims the most youthful population, as well as the highest rates of poverty and unemployment, in the district, coupled with a high dependency ratio. The economy is underperforming and currently fails to create needed jobs and revenues. A dedicated LED strategy has been developed in order to guide interventions in turning this situation around. The municipality’s low productivity score points to the low GDP per worker (formal and informal), a relative shortage of skills available to the economy, and low growth. On a broad scale, the Dr AB Xuma Municipality has some striking features: it is a peripheral area in terms of the national economy, is underdeveloped, has a fragmented settlement pattern, has a low-density rural settlement environment, and its resource base is under pressure. On the scale of urban development, Engcobo Town is classified as a Sub-District Development Node by CHDM (i.e. it is among a group of towns deemed to be on a second tier below the dominant district node of Komani). This means that Engcobo is understood to have an influence (reach or catchment population) beyond simply its local area and that it draws people to the town to access goods and services from a broader area (i.e. in some cases even from neighbouring municipalities). However, Engcobo may also currently be described as a low-density urban environment. In spite of its low density and intensity of development, Engcobo’s business centre is thriving, though it does not function optimally due to overcrowding and a lack of facilities serving both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Business in the town is reliant on commuters (rural consumers) and there is no mass of resident consumers. This limits the range of commercial and social facilities that the private sector provides in town and inhibits the development of a more vibrant urban character.",

There are very low levels of employment in the rural settlements. This can be partly attributed to the fact that these areas do not have a strong economic base, and partly to the fact that most inhabitants are involved in subsistence-related activities with little surplus being produced for economic profit. Due to the migrant system in operation in South Africa, the impact of recessionary downturns in the economy elsewhere (such as in the mining industry, Gauteng and Cape Town) have had an impact on the Elundini area.

It is the largest of seven municipalities in the district, making up a quarter of its geographical area. The N2 National Road forms the main transportation conduit across the municipality. Hessequa has a moderate climate. Rainfall occurs predominantly in winter and reaches totals of 300mm inland to 1 000mm on the coast. The Little Karoo in the rain shadow of the Langeberg is the driest region. Agricultural activities are largely determined by the local rainfall pattern. Most of the basal geology in Hessequa has been influenced by the Cape Fold Belt, which has caused the east-west heading mountains generally comprising hard quartzite sandstone and thin shale bands of the Table Mountain Group. Hessequa’s vegetation falls within the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is characterised by its exceptional richness in plant species. More than 8 700 species are known to occur, of which two thirds are endemic. About 75% of all plants in the South African Red Data Book are found in the Cape Floral Kingdom. Of these species, about 1 700 are threatened with extinction. The major biomes occurring within Hessequa may be divided into nine major vegetation groups.",

It shares its borders with the Central Karoo District to the north and Cape Winelands District in the east. It is one of seven municipalities in the district. Kannaland is situated about 340km north-east of Cape Town along the famous tourism Route 62. It is linked by tarred main roads to all other major centres, such as Oudtshoorn (100km), Montagu (139km), George (160km), Mossel Bay (185km) and Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) (420km). Both the administrative and legislative seats of Kannaland Municipality are located in Ladismith, with satellite offices in Calitzdorp, Vanwyksdorp and Zoar. The municipality is responsible for basic service provision to the towns of Calitzdorp, Ladismith, Vanwyksdorp and Zoar, as well as the surrounding farming communities. Kannaland’s climate is ideal for the production of apricots, peaches, plums, nectarines and grapes. The well-known Parmalat and Ladismith dairy products come from the area. The quaint little haven of Calitzdorp is known as the port-wine capitol of South Africa by virtue of the top quality wines, produced mainly by Boplaas, De Krans, Axehill and Calitzdorp wine cellars. The Kannaland municipal area lies huddled between two mountain ranges, the Swartberge and Anysberg. An impressive mountain peak called Towerkop (2 198m) looms above Ladismith. Another impressive site is Elandsberg (2 128m). Halfway up Elandsberg is a famous landmark, sometimes referred to as Ladismith’s extra star in the galaxy: Stanley's Light (1 500m). A wide variety of scenic routes criss-cross the area. Kannaland has its own individual building style, which makes it unique. For example, the so-called Ladismith Style is a simplified Georgian design and dates from the 1830s.",

The town lies in a geologically fascinating area, steeped in history and tradition. It dates back to the mid-1700s. In those years, farmers along the banks of the Buffels River offered hospitality to adventurers brave enough to cross the mountains and venture out onto the arid plains of the Great Karoo. In exchange for news of Cape Town and the civilized world, as well as gossip garnered from other farms along the way, these isolated farmers of the interior offered accommodation, sustenance and fodder. Many early officials and explorers, such as Barrow, Lichtenstein, De Mist and Swellengrebel, wrote of the people they met in what was later to become the district of Laingsburg. They described the Karoo as ‘awesome, hot, dry and dusty. An inhospitable land peppered with friendly outspans, veritable jewels in the desert'. Today, it is a worthwhile and hospitable stop on the busy N1 highway through the Great Karoo.",

It is the smallest of four municipalities that make up the district. The uThukela River is the largest river in KwaZulu-Natal, and was the historical border between Zululand and Natal. Mandeni Local Municipality is strategically located midway between Durban and Richards Bay, and lies on the development corridor on the north coast between these two major port cities in KwaZulu-Natal. It is located on the major railway and road transportation routes which link these two economic hubs. This strategic location is also acknowledged in the Provincial Spatial Framework, which has identified Mandeni as the growth node in the north coast corridor. The construction of the new Dube Trade Port and King Shaka International Airport has much economic, social and employment implications for the municipality because of its location. Mandeni is the only urban settlement of substance and functions as the service centre for a substantial hinterland. Mandeni consists of fragmented pockets of intensive urban settlement separated by areas of little or no development. Four rural settlements, Hlomendlini, Macambini, Mathonsi and Ndulinde, are each under an Inkosi. All are underdeveloped and have major backlogs in service provision. The municipality has no capacity to supply the whole area with electricity. Transport infrastructure is well developed, with a high standard of road and rail services into the area.",

It is situated about 65km from Johannesburg and is serviced by a number of major roads, including the N12 from Johannesburg to Cape Town and the N14, which is the main road between Gauteng and Mahikeng (previously Mafikeng) via Ventersdorp. Its boundaries enclose some of the richest gold mines in the world. Formerly a cross-border municipality, the entire municipality was transferred to the North West Province following the abolition of cross-border municipalities by an amendment to the South African Constitution in 2005. The municipality was part of the North West Province from 2005 to 2009, when it was reincorporated into the Gauteng Province by another amendment to the Constitution, following often violent protests in the township of Khutsong. Merafong's historical development is closely knit with the discovery of rich gold deposits in the early 1930s. Fochville is the oldest town in the region, and was declared a town in 1951. The town Carletonville was named after Guy Carleton Jones, an engineer from the Gold Fields Ltd mining company, who played a prominent role in the discovery of the West Wits gold field, of which Carletonville forms a part. The mining company decided, in November 1946, to establish the town. Carletonville was proclaimed in 1948 and attained Town Council Status on 1 July 1959. Wedela is situated between Western Deep Levels and Elandsrand mine. The town's name is derived from the prefixes of the two mines: the ‘Wed-' from Western Deep Levels and the ‘-ela' from Elandsrand. Wedela was established as a mining village in December 1978 by Harry Oppenheimer, and municipal status was granted to the town on 1 January 1990.",

Much of its economy originates from these sources. Three major sawmills, Mondi, Tafibra and PG Bison, are located just outside of eMkhondo. These play a crucial role in boosting a well-diversified economy, and the other components of manufacturing, personal services, real estate and tourism. Amsterdam/KwaThandeka and its rural nodes in the Mkhondo municipal area are fundamentally agricultural and have forestry support. Mondi, Sappi, TWK and Komati Land Forests are the major companies that lead the forestry industry in the area. Several scattered pockets of mining are found in the municipal area of jurisdiction. Natural conservation and tourist activities also contribute towards the socio-economic conditions of the municipality. A number of South African Heritage Sites are found within the municipality. These include the Entombe Battlefield, Rooikraal, Confidence, Kalkoenvlakte and Heyshope Dam.

The ideally-situated agricultural and trading centre of Bergville, less than 50km from the towering Amphitheatre of Royal Natal, was laid out by a retired sea captain in 1897. Two years later, at the onset of the Anglo-Boer War, British forces built a blockhouse in the settlement. The building is now a monument and museum within the grounds of the Bergville Courthouse. Bergville is a small town and is known as the gateway to the Northern Drakensberg. Approximately half a million tourists are attracted to the Drakensberg annually. Bergville hosts an office of the Drakensberg Publicity Association. The area is relatively well linked through the network of existing provincial roads that run through the municipality. The municipality is largely reliant on uMnambithi (Ladysmith) for facilities such as shopping, medical services and education, among others. Large capital expenditure is needed to meet service backlogs in the area.The council manages a caravan park and holiday huts on the bank of the uThukela River. A playground and facilities for sports, including swimming, tennis, bowls, cricket, golf, rugby and badminton, are available. A modern community hall serves as a town hall.",

It is one of the seven municipalities in the district. The Greater Oudtshoorn area is nestled at the foot of the Swartberg Mountains in the heart of the Little Karoo region in the Western Cape. It is defined as a semi-desert area with a unique and sensitive natural environment. It was once the indigenous home of the Khoisan people, and so there are many rock paintings to be found. The municipality's development potential recognises the impact of being home to the world’s largest ostrich population, which is a key component of their agricultural industry. The discovery of the Cango Caves and continual allure of unique natural heritage has drawn people to this region. Oudtshoorn serves as a regional centre for the surrounding agricultural area. The natural environment of the area creates a natural hospitality towards the tourism industry, and a related boom in accommodation. Oudtshoorn is a centre of regional cultural, sport and art activities, and has, since 1994, been host to the nationally famous Klein Karoo Nasionale Kuntefees (KKNK), an arts festival held in March/April every year. A total of 411 temporary job opportunities were created directly by the ABSA KKNK, of which 76% were filled by black employees. The total economic impact of the ABSA KKNK is estimated at about R110 million, which makes the festival a major contributor to the economy in Oudtshoorn. A joint strategy was developed through the Greater Oudtshoorn Vision 2030 process to ensure both the broader benefaction of local communities and the sustainability of the festival. Oudtshoorn's relatively higher ‘development potential' is directly linked to its geographic location on main transport routes, natural resource base, human resources, institutional centre function, and commercial services. Recent studies of Oudtshoorn growth potential identified it as one of 14 important ‘leader towns' in the Western Cape province.",

Known to the locals as ‘the gem of the Northern Cape', Prieska is the seat of the municipality and is located on the hills of the Doring Mountains on the southern banks of the Orange River. Prieska's infrastructure is impressive – it has Eskom power; an abundant water supply from the Orange River, with the Gariep and the Vanderkloof Dams on the upstream side of the river; easy access to the main railway line to Namibia; good tarred road linkage with Kimberley, Upington and De Aar; two landing strips for light aircraft; and complete and reasonably inexpensive industrial stands, with or without siding facilities. Industrial activities include: grain silos; a cotton mill; a bakery; manufacture of furniture, built-in cupboards; cattle fodder pellets; and a tiger’s eye processing plant. Niekerkshoop is attractively placed between hills, and large trees shade the streets. There is no domestic water supply but irrigation water is supplied by a spring to the north of the town. On the north-west side of Marydale is a rich underground water source, and the main means of water supply is by borehole and wind pumps. It depends mainly on sheep farming.",

The town obtained municipal status in 1860. Malmesbury fulfils an important urban niche in the region and the province. Its high development potential can be attributed to factors such as its relative accessibility along the N7 road/rail corridor; closeness to Cape Town; diversified economic base, which not only accommodates agriculture but also well-developed industrial and commercial sectors; and supportive infrastructure. The high property values in the Cape Town Metropole and the attraction of a local tranquil atmosphere are moving people to settle here and commute to Cape Town on a daily basis.

The municipality was the first to implement Service Level Agreements in all its towns to narrow the gap between community services needs and municipal service delivery abilities. The municipality created capacities for holistic and quality developments, i.e. sewerage removal, quality water, housing, communication, waste removal and infrastructural maintenance. In addition, the municipality participated in processes that led to a peaceful and safe environment where the welfare of everyone, and especially that of women and children, is highly valued and pursued.

The municipal area is dominated by tribal areas, and 14 tribal authorities exist within the area. The town of Eshowe is of great historical significance in that it is the birthplace of Cetshwayo, who was king of the Zulus during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Eshowe Town is also considered the administrative and service centre of the uMlalazi Municipality.

The rest of the area consists of tribal authority land, where land management has been poor. It is characterised by an undulating topography, causing difficulties with respect to the delivery of engineering services. The uMlalazi Municipality is crossed by a number of important transportation routes, such as the N2 motorway between Durban and Richards Bay, the R34 between Richards Bay/Empangeni and Nkwaleni Valley to the north of Eshowe, and the R66 from the N2 motorway to KwaGingindlovu, Eshowe, eMthonjaneni (Melmoth), Ulundi and Vryheid.",

However, in the remaining portion there are towns built by German immigrants some 150 years ago. In the 1850s, 13 cotton planter families from Osnabruck unter Bergthell left Germany and settled in the area. They were followed by missionaries and other colonists, mostly from Hanover, who also settled in the region, founded New Hanover and Wartburg, and brought with them not only the Lutheran faith but the German language and culture. Wartburg itself is named after the castle in Eisenach, where Dr Martin Luther translated the bible into German. The village crest also depicts the immigrants’ arrival by sailing ship, the Luther Rose, and the call to ‘pray and work'. The land is mostly agricultural, although urban development is to be found in the main towns. The communities living in the underdeveloped areas have extremely limited access to basic physical and social requirements and very few economic opportunities. The present authority structures are, as yet, unable to provide for the improvement of basic living conditions urgently required by the rural inhabitants.",

It is one of four municipalities in the district, making up almost a third of its geographical area. The nature of the topography is such that uMsinga is largely located in deep gorges of the Tugela and Buffalo Rivers. This effectively isolates the area from the immediate surrounding municipal areas. uMsinga is accessible via the R33, linking it with Dundee, uMnambithi (Ladysmith), Pietermaritzburg, Kranskop and Weenen. It is a largely rural area, with 70% of its area being traditional authority land held in trust by the Ingonyama Trust. The remaining 30% of land is commercial farmland, all of which is located to the north of Pomeroy. Due to the rural nature of the municipality, approximately 99% of the population lives in traditional areas. The population dynamics result in a growing rural area and a declining urban area in uMsinga, contrary to most other areas in the country. This can be attributed to the fact that the urban areas of uMsinga are very small and are unable to provide the normal range of goods and services provided in urban areas. As a result, the population utilises the neighbouring areas of Emnambithi and Umvoti for urban services. The strong traditional culture, particularly prevalent in uMsinga, is a valuable asset that must be preserved and valued. These traditional areas provide support mechanisms for the communities, as well as living custodians of the culture.",
