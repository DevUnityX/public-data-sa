    "description": "The Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality is a Category A municipality situated on the east coast of the Eastern Cape Province. The boundaries of the newly established municipality now include a large area characterised by very different features. Two former municipalities, Transitional Local Councils – that of East London and Qonce (King William's Town) – have merged into one. Other areas that were previously not included in either of them are now part of Buffalo City. The municipality was established as a local municipality in 2000 after South Africa's reorganisation of municipal areas and is named after the Buffalo River, at whose mouth lies the only river port in South Africa. On 18 May 2011 it was separated from the Amathole District Municipality and converted into a metropolitan municipality. History was made in Buffalo City when the City elected its first female mayor on Friday, 17 March 2006. The area has a well-developed manufacturing base, with the auto industry playing a major role. The climate is mild, with year-round sunshine. Average rainfall is 850mm.",

The former administrations of the nine towns in the former East Rand were amalgamated into the metropolitan municipality, along with the Khayalami Metropolitan Council and the Eastern Gauteng Services Council. It is one of the most densely populated areas in the province, and the country. The economy in the region is larger and more diverse than that of many small countries in Africa. It accounts for nearly a quarter of Gauteng's economy, which in turn contributes over a third of the national Gross Domestic Product. Many of the factories for production of goods and commodities are located in Ekurhuleni, often referred to as ‘Africa's Workshop'. The network of roads, airports, rail lines, telephones, electricity grids and telecommunications found in Ekurhuleni rivals that of Europe and America. It can be regarded as the transportation hub of the country. It is home to OR Tambo International Airport; South Africa's largest railway hub; a number of South Africa's modern freeways and expressways; the Maputo Corridor Development; direct rail, road and air links connecting Ekurhuleni to Durban; the Blue IQ projects, with linkages to the City Deep Container terminal; the planned Gautrain rapid rail link to Johannesburg and Pretoria; and the OR Tambo International Airport Industrial Development Zone (IDZ).",

    "description": "The City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality is located in the Gauteng Province. Johannesburg is the most advanced commercial city in Africa and the engine room of the South African and regional economy. It is a city with a unique, African character, world-class infrastructure in the fields of telecommunications, transportation, water and power, and with globally-competitive health care and educational facilities. However, the city is also one of contrasts – home to both wealthy and poor, residents and refugees, global corporations and emerging enterprises. The demographics of Johannesburg indicate a large and ethnically diverse metropolitan area. As the largest city in South Africa, its population is defined by a long history of local and international migration. Johannesburg is home to almost five million people, accounting for about 36% of Gauteng's population and 8% of the national population. Over the last decade the city has been growing. A key contributor to this is that the city continues to attract people from other provinces, and internationally, who are looking for better economic opportunities and quality of life. The population pyramid indicates that the city’s population is predominantly young. This can be attributed to migration from other parts of the country as young people look for jobs. Johannesburg is considered the economic hub of South Africa and is often the first choice of destination by job seekers across the country.",

The City of Tshwane is the single-largest metropolitan municipality in the country, comprising seven regions, 105 wards and 210 councillors. Pretoria is the capital of South Africa. It has the second-largest number of embassies in the world after Washington DC. Many embassies thus call this city their home. The Union Buildings house the administrative hub of the country and have also been the setting for the presidential inaugurations of Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and the incumbent South African president, Jacob Zuma. These sandstone buildings offer beautiful views over the City. Its rich and colourful heritage is reflected in the City's myriad of museums, monuments and historical buildings, and is punctuated by contemporary arts and crafts markets, bringing the City alive with a unique blend of new and old. The Science and Technology Museum offers a tactile experience of science at work. The South African mint has a minting press dating back to 1892 that is still in operation. The City also offers township sleepovers with a five-star stay. Church Square and the State Theatre often host international and national performances. There are also two nature reserves where visitors can view wildlife such as buffalo, antelope, cheetah, jackal, giraffe and sable.",

    "description": "The Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality is a Category A municipality. It is situated in the Free State Province, in the central interior of South Africa. The Free State is bordered by the Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and North West Provinces, as well as by the neighbouring country of Lesotho. Mangaung, meaning ‘Place of the Cheetahs', accentuates the vibrant, dynamic and energetic character of the tourism industry in the 'At the Heart of it All'. The economy is strongly driven by the government sector, which has seen the fastest growth in the last five years as a result of increased government programmes in livelihoods improvement interventions. The finance sector is the second-fastest growing sector due to very active estate and construction activities. Small businesses have a major role to play in the South African, and especially the Mangaung, economy in terms of employment creation, income generation and output growth. It is estimated that more than 12 million people in South Africa are actively involved in the SMME sector, which accounts for approximately 60% of all employment in the economy and 40% of output. In an area such as Mangaung, with its relatively high levels of unemployment and poverty, it can be expected that the SMME sector plays an even more important role in job creation and poverty alleviation. The informal economy makes an important contribution to the economic and social life of Mangaung. Due to the decline in formal employment and consequent increase in unemployment, many people seek alternative means of earning an income.",
